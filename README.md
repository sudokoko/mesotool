## Installation Instructions
> **Note:** Currently the pre-compiled binaries in the Releases tab support aarch64 strictly. While something like QEMU may work, you will most likely face broken library errors (as seen in previous testing).
1. Download the latest executable from the Releases tab. *(Alternatively, you can download the latest source code tarball from the Releases tab and run `main.py` yourself)*
2. Mark the file as executable, if unable to run. `chmod +x mesotool_x.x.x_rel_arch`
3. Run the executable by typing `./mesotool_x.x.x_rel_arch`.

## Having Trouble?
Open an issue in the Issues tab.
